# Crypto-value-aproximator

ML project made in Python done as homework for the "Computer programming and programming languages 3" course.

It does the task of predicting the current value of cryptocurrencies by solving a regression problem. It does this by analyzing key market indicators such as market capitalization, trading volume, daily price range, percentage price changes, circulating and total supply, as well as the all-time high and low values. It also retrieves all the necessary cryptocurrency data automatically through the [CoinGeckoAPI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api).
